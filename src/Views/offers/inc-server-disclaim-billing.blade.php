    While tracking billable hours, Rockhopper rounds each session down to
    the nearest 5 minute increment, so you really get your money's worth.
    Any increases in billing will approved with your team
    <i>before</i> appearing on any invoice.

<p class="rockTxtSize slGrey">
    One month after the day your software has been installed,
    monthly invoicing will begin for continued tech support.
    Unless otherwise arranged, Rockhopper will invoice you at the start
    of each month for being on-call that month.

    If you happen to provide goods or services that the Rockhopper team needs,
    then barter arrangements may be possible.
